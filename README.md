# INITIALIZE
- Go to the root folder and type "npm install" so all the depedencies would be installed.
- Type "npm start" to start the project.

# Note
- Port is not changed so it is still default (3000).
- Because the requirement said it should be able to run on other pc's, i'm avoiding using too much dependencies too prevent interference (eg. sass, typescript, etc).
- The project mainly designed with bootstrap and vanilla css to save time.
- !There is no link for a picture in the pokemon api, and other pokemon api which had it already died, so there is no picture in the final.
